## Retro Barcode Generator

Create an application which will preset the user a row of colored boxes. The colors should be in random order. One way to accomplish this is to create an array of random colors in your <i>app.component.ts</i> file and use them with interpolation. (You can find color names from https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp).
